o matchPDict() now returns a PDictMatches object (new) instead of a list of
  integer vectors. The user can then convert this PDictMatches object into
  a list of integer vectors with as.list (slow for now, needs to be improved)
  or subset it with [[. Other methods will be added later in order to provide
  the user with a wider choice of conversion/extraction tools.

o Added the matchPDict() function for efficiently finding all occurences in
  a text (the subject) of any pattern from a set of patterns (the dictionary).
  See ?matchPDict for the details (especially the current limitations).

o Renamed Exfiles/ folder as extdata/ and put back fastaEx in it (from
  Biostrings 1).

o Added the dna2rna(), rna2dna(), transcribe() and cDNA() functions + a
  "reverseComplement" method for RNAString objects.

o Added the findPalindromes() function for basic support of palindrome finding.
  Also added related utility functions palindromeArmLength(),
  palindromeLeftArm() and palindromeRightArm().
