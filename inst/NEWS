**************************************************

o Added support for a Biostrings C interface (work-in-progress).
  See inst/include/Biostrings_interface.h for how to use it in your package.

o Added the isMatching() function.

o Added support in matchPDict() for inexact matching of a dictionary with
  "trusted prefixes". See ?`matchPDict-inexact` for the details.

o Added support for empty BString (and derived) objects.

o Added the "BStringList", "DNAStringList", "RNAStringList" and "AAStringList"
  classes. Not used yet but will be soon... (more news to come here)

o Renamed the 'mismatch' arg -> 'max.mismatch' for the matchPattern(),
  matchLRPatterns() and matchPDict() functions.

o Added "matchLRPatterns" and "matchProbePair" methods for BStringViews
  objects.

o Made the "show" methods for BString, BStringViews and BStringAlign objects
  "getOption('width') aware" so that the user can control the width of the
  output they produce.

o Change in terminology to align with established practices: "fuzzy matching"
  is now called "inexact matching". This change mostly affects the
  documentation. The only change at the API level that is a consequence of
  this change in terminology is that the "naive-fuzzy" algo is now called
  "naive-inexact" (this affects the matchPattern() function and possibly any
  function with an 'algo' argument).

o Renamed some files in inst/extdata/ to use the same extension (.fa) for all
  FASTA files.

o Added the dinucleotideFrequency(), trinucleotideFrequency(),
  oligonucleotideFrequency(), strrev() and mkAllStrings() functions.

o Two small changes in alphabetFrequency():
  (1) when used with 'baseOnly=TRUE', the frequency of the gap letter ("-") is
      not returned anymore (now it's treated as any 'other' letter i.e. any
      non-base letter);
  (2) added the 'freq' argument.

o Implemented the "shortcut feature" to C function CWdna_exact_search().
  With this patch, using matchPDict() to find all the matches of a
  3.3M 32-mers dictionary in the full Human genome (+ and - strands of all
  chromosomes) is about 2.5x faster than before (will take between 20 minutes
  and 2 hours depending on your machine and the number of matches found).
  This puts matchPDict() at the same level as the Vmatch software
  (http://www.vmatch.de/) for a dictionary of this size. Memory footprint
  for matchPDict() is about 2GB for the Aho-Corasick tree built from the
  3.3M 32-mers dictionary. Building this tree is still very fast (2 or 3
  minutes) (Vmatch needs 60G of disk space to build all its suffix arrays,
  don't know how long it takes for this, don't know what's the memory
  footprint either when they are loaded into memory but it looks like it
  is several Gigas).
  matchPDict() only works with a dictionary of DNA patterns where all the
  patterns have the same number of nucleotides and it does only exact
  matching for now (Vmatch doesn't have this kind of limitations).

o Added "as.character" and "consmat" methods for "BStringAlign" objects.

o matchPattern.Rnw vignette replaced by much improved GenomeSearching.Rnw
  vignette (still a work-in-progress).

o reverse(), complement() and reverseComplement() now preserve desc(x) when
  applied to BStringViews object x.

o matchPDict() now returns a ViewsIndex object (new class) instead of a list
  of integer vectors. The user can then extract the starts or the ends of
  the matches with startIndex() or endIndex(), extract the number of matches
  per pattern with countIndex(), extract the matches for a given pattern with
  [[, put all the matches in a single Views object with unlist() or convert
  this ViewsIndex object into a set of views on the original subject with
  extractAllMatches().
  Other functions can be added later in order to provide a wider choice of
  extraction/conversion tools if necessary.
  WARNING: This is still a work-in-progress. Function names and semantics are
  not yet stabilized!

o Added the Views class (see ?Views for the details). Changed the definition
  of the BStringViews class so now it extends the Views class.

o Added the patternFrequency() generic function and a method for CWdna_PDict
  objects (will come later for TBdna_PDict objects).

o Added a "duplicated" method for CWdna_PDict objects (will come later for
  TBdna_PDict objects).

o Added the matchPDict() and countPDict() functions for efficiently finding
  (or just counting) all occurences in a text (the subject) of any pattern
  from a set of patterns (the dictionary). The types of pattern dictionaries
  currently supported are constant width DNA dictionaries (CWdna_PDict
  objects) and "Trusted Prefix" DNA dictionaries (a particular case of
  "Trusted Band" DNA dictionaries, represented by TBdna_PDict objects).
  See ?matchPDict for the details (especially the current limitations).

o Renamed Exfiles/ folder as extdata/ and put back fastaEx in it (from
  Biostrings 1).

o By Robert: Added the dna2rna(), rna2dna(), transcribe() and cDNA() functions
  + a "reverseComplement" method for RNAString objects.

o Added basic support for palindrome finding: it can be achieved with the
  new findPalindromes() and findComplementedPalindromes() functions.
  Also added related utility functions palindromeArmLength(),
  palindromeLeftArm(), palindromeRightArm(), complementedPalindromeArmLength(),
  complementedPalindromeLeftArm() and complementedPalindromeRightArm().

o Added the matchLRPatterns() function for finding in a sequence patterns
  that are defined by a left and a right part.
  See ?matchLRPatterns for the details.
