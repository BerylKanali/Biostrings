o Applied "matchPDict() boost feature" patch:
  With this patch, finding all the matches of a 3.3M 32-mers dictionary in
  the full Human genome (+ and - strands of all chromosomes) is about 2.5x
  faster than before (will take between 20 minutes and 2 hours depending on
  your machine and the number of matches found).
  This puts matchPDict() at the same level as the Vmatch software
  (http://www.vmatch.de/) for a dictionary of this size. Memory footprint
  for matchPDict() is about 2GB for the Aho-Corasick tree built from the
  3.3M 32-mers dictionary. Building this tree is still very fast (2 or 3
  minutes) (Vmatch needs 60G of disk space to build all its suffix arrays,
  don't know how long it takes for this, don't know what's the memory
  footprint either when they are loaded into memory but it looks like it
  is several Gigas).
  matchPDict() only works with a dictionary of DNA patterns where all the
  patterns have the same number of nucleotides and it does only exact
  matching for now (Vmatch doesn't have this kind of limitations).

o Added "as.character" and "consmat" methods for "BStringAlign" objects.

o matchPattern.Rnw vignette replaced by much improved GenomeSearching.Rnw
  vignette (still a work-in-progress).

o reverse(), complement() and reverseComplement() now preserve desc(x) when
  applied to BStringViews object x.

o matchPDict() now returns a P2Views object (new class) instead of a list
  of integer vectors. The user can then extract the starts or the ends of
  the matches with p2start() or p2end(), extract the number of matches per
  pattern with p2nview(), extract the matches for a given pattern with [[,
  put all the matches in a single Views object with unlist() or convert
  the P2Views object into a set of views on the original subject with
  extractAllMatches().
  Other functions can be added later in order to provide a wider choice of
  extraction/conversion tools if necessary.
  WARNING: This is still a work-in-progress. Function names and semantics are
  not yet stabilized!

o Added the matchPDict() function for efficiently finding all occurences in
  a text (the subject) of any pattern from a set of patterns (the dictionary).
  See ?matchPDict for the details (especially the current limitations).

o Renamed Exfiles/ folder as extdata/ and put back fastaEx in it (from
  Biostrings 1).

o Added the dna2rna(), rna2dna(), transcribe() and cDNA() functions + a
  "reverseComplement" method for RNAString objects.

o Added the findPalindromes() function for basic support of palindrome finding.
  Also added related utility functions palindromeArmLength(),
  palindromeLeftArm() and palindromeRightArm().

o Added the matchLRPatterns() function for finding in a sequence patterns
  that are defined by a left and a right part.
  See ?matchLRPatterns for the details.
