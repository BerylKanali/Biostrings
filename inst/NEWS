o Added "as.character" and "consmat" methods for "BStringAlign" objects.

o matchPattern.Rnw vignette replaced by much improved GenomeSearching.Rnw
  vignette (still a work-in-progress).

o reverse(), complement() and reverseComplement() now preserve desc(x) when
  applied to BStringViews object x.

o matchPDict() now returns a P2Views object (new class) instead of a list
  of integer vectors. The user can then extract the starts or the ends of
  the matches with p2start() or p2end(), extract the number of matches per
  pattern with p2nview(), extract the matches for a given pattern with [[,
  or convert it into a set of views on the original subject with
  extractAllMatches().
  Other functions can be added later in order to provide a wider choice of
  extraction/conversion tools if necessary.
  WARNING: This is still a work-in-progress. Function names and semantics are
  not yet stabilized!

o Added the matchPDict() function for efficiently finding all occurences in
  a text (the subject) of any pattern from a set of patterns (the dictionary).
  See ?matchPDict for the details (especially the current limitations).

o Renamed Exfiles/ folder as extdata/ and put back fastaEx in it (from
  Biostrings 1).

o Added the dna2rna(), rna2dna(), transcribe() and cDNA() functions + a
  "reverseComplement" method for RNAString objects.

o Added the findPalindromes() function for basic support of palindrome finding.
  Also added related utility functions palindromeArmLength(),
  palindromeLeftArm() and palindromeRightArm().

o Added the matchLRPatterns() function for finding in a sequence patterns
  that are defined by a left and a right part.
  See ?matchLRPatterns for the details.
