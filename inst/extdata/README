- The chr*fa and someORF.fa files were extracted from
  ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/sequence
  on 1 Nov 2005. -- VJC

- Only the someORF.fa and fastaEx.fa files have been kept from Biostrings 1
  (original names were someORF.fsa and fastaEx). -- H. Pages

- dm3_upstream2000.fa.gz was obtained with the following R code (using BioC
  devel on 14 May 2014):

    library(BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3)
    genome <- BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3
    library(TxDb.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3.ensGene)  # version 2.14.0
    txdb <- TxDb.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3.ensGene

    ## Because the chrU and chrUextra sequences are made of concatenated
    ## scaffolds (see http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=dm3),
    ## extracting the upstream sequences for genes located on these
    ## scaffolds is not reliable. So we exclude them:
    exclude <- c("chrU", "chrUextra")
    dm3_upstream2000 <- extractUpstreamSeqs(genome, txdb, width=2000,
                                            exclude.seqlevels=exclude)
    writeXStringSet(dm3_upstream2000, "dm3_upstream2000.fa.gz", compress=TRUE)
