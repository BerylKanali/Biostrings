CHANGES SINCE Biostrings 1 (v 1.4.z)

The following bugs and design flaws have been addressed:

  o DNAString() was quadratic in time. In Biostrings 2 this function
    has been replaced by BStringViews which is much faster (linear in time).

  o matchDNAPattern() was broken in many ways:

    - The "offset problem":
        d <- DNAString("AA","TTT")
        m <- matchDNAPattern("TT", d[2])
      was returning wrong matches.
      This problem was in fact the consequence of a flaw in the design
      of the BioString class and was the first motivation for reworking
      the core Biostrings classes that are the fundations of Biostrings 2
      (see the Biostrings2Classes vignette for an introduction to these new
      classes).

   - The "negative offset problem":
        matchDNAPattern("AAA", "ACT", mismatch=2)
      was displaying a first empty match.

   - The "fuzzy searching" problems:
       Pb1: Fuzzy searching (mismatch != 0) was almost always returning a
       wrong result because of a bug in the implementation of the "shift-or"
       algorithm.
       Pb2: Only mismatch <= 3 was supported (now it's illimited even if
       it doesn't make sense to use mismatch >= length(subject)).
       Pb3: Some "of limits matches" (i.e. matches starting before the first
       letter of the subject or ending after its last letter) could be
       missing. And when they were found, the show() method was in general
       not able to display them properly.

    - This was provoking a bus-error bug on Solaris 2.9 and Mac OS X:
        > pattern <- DNAString("AAAA")
        > subject <- DNAString("AAAAC")
        > matchDNAPattern(pattern, subject, mis=2)
