For 1.99.13

- add matchPattern and countPattern for subject="character" and
  subject="BStringViews" (only works if length(subject) == 1)

- what the semantic of the alphabetFrequency() function in Biostrings 1
  when @offsets overlap or don't cover the whole string? test.
  Implement it in C.

- For the needwunsQS generic, use a .needwunsQS backend function.
  In the backend:
    - remove test of s1 and s2 lengths (will be done in the front-end now)
    - expl() is not needed anymore, s1 and s2 are assumed to be ALREADY
      SUBSETTABLE (s1[i] is i-th letter), so we can replace es1 and es2
      by s1 and s2 everywhere.
  We want to support the following signatures:
    - s1 and s2 character vectors: if length(s1) != 1 or length(s2) != 1
      then stop else s1 and s2 are safeExploded before
      they are passed to the backend,
    - s1="BString" or s2="BString":
      if s1 or s2 is character then if length(s1) != 1 or length(s2) != 1
      then stop else convert the character-string to the class of the other
      before to call the backend,
      if class(s1) == class(s2) call the backend directly,
      (now we are sure that both are at least a BString)
      convert the derived BString to a BString (both can be derived BStrings,
      e.g. s1 is DNAString and s2 is RNAString)
    - No support of s1 or s2 = BStringViews.

- compare NAMESPACE + list of aliases in Rd files from Biostrings 1 and 2
  make sure not important feature has been lost 

- update the CHANGES file


Later

- improve the Rd files (a lot of TODO tags have to be replaced by real
  documentation in there)

- test Raphael use case on hgu95av2 package

- fix pb with length(x) <- 2 screwing up x if it's a BString or BStringViews
  object (prevent people of doing this by defining the replacement version
  of the length method)

- remove the Biostrings 1 subdir

- implement .needwunsQS in C

- merge SuffixTree package from Robert
