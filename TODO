For 2.5.10

- Vectorize matchPattern() (result will be a list of BStringViews
  objects).

- Make alphabetFrequency works with BStringViews objects with
  "out of limits" views.

- Merge ~rgentlem/tmp/EMBOSS-3.0.0/emboss/matcher.c (Huang & Miller
  alignment algo) into Biostrings.

- An old Robert request: "have a look at GeneR, and see if there are
  any other packages that do sequence matching, and describe, in one page or
  so, what the differences are between the packages (also some notion of speed
  and size, how well do they work on different inputs)".


For 2.5.11

- Have the BStringViews() method for BString objects support the 'sep' arg.

- Test Raphael use case with built-in string functions and compare speed
  with Biostrings solution. Add the conclusions to the matchPattern.Rnw
  vignette.

- Add the substr() method for BString objects (returns a character-string)
  and for BStringViews objects (returns a character vector of same length
  than its first arg).

- Why doesn't sapply or lapply work for a BStringViews object (it didn't
  work either for BioString objects). Isn't it enough that these objects
  are subsettable?

- Compare NAMESPACE + list of aliases in Rd files from Biostrings 1 and 2
  make sure no important feature has been lost.

- Update the CHANGES file.


Later

- Restore the test units.

- Improve the Rd files (a lot of TODO tags have to be replaced by real
  documentation there).

- Fix pb with length(x) <- 2 screwing up x if it's a BString or BStringViews
  object (prevent people of doing this by defining the replacement version
  of the length method and issuing an error).

- Still have to think about it (Robert suggestion): make [[ work on "out
  of limits" views with a warning (we keep issuing an error only when the
  view is all blank).

- Remove the Biostrings 1 subdir.

- Merge SuffixTree package from Robert.
