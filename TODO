For 1.99.14

- Before to have an alphabetFrequency method for BStringViews objects,
  check what is the semantic of the alphabetFrequency() function in
  Biostrings 1 when @offsets overlap or don't cover the whole string? test.

- Implement the alphabetFrequency method in C.

- why doesn't sapply or lapply work for a BStringViews object (it didn't
  work either for BioString objects). Isn't it enough that these objects
  are subsettable?

- compare NAMESPACE + list of aliases in Rd files from Biostrings 1 and 2
  make sure no important feature has been lost 

- update the CHANGES file


Later

- improve the Rd files (a lot of TODO tags have to be replaced by real
  documentation there)

- fix pb with length(x) <- 2 screwing up x if it's a BString or BStringViews
  object (prevent people of doing this by defining the replacement version
  of the length method and issuing an error)

- remove the Biostrings 1 subdir

- implement .needwunsQS in C

- merge SuffixTree package from Robert
