Some R problems maybe worth to report:

- Loading a serialized BStringViews object without prior loading the Biostrings
  package seems to have problems: the object loads, but, when I try to display
  it, then nothing is printed and the prompt doesn't come back either (unless I
  CTRL C).


In 2.[6|7]
==========

- Fix this: 
    > matchPattern("ab", "xyz", mismatch=2)
      Views on a 3-letter BString subject
    Subject: xyz
    Views:
        start end width
    [1]    -1   0     2 [  ]
    [2]     0   1     2 [ x]
    [3]     1   2     2 [xy]
    [4]     2   3     2 [yz]
    [5]     3   4     2 [z ]
  Either the (start=4,end=5) match should be included, or the (start=-1,end=0)
  match should not. An alternative is to raise an error (or a warning) when
  mismatch >= nchar(pattern).


In 2.7
======

- Rework findPalindromes() (and findComplementedPalindromes()) so that they
  return maximum palindromes only.

- matchPDict():
  o Add countPDict() function (like we have a countPattern() function) for
    counting the matches only.
  o Make reverseComplement() work on a PDict object.
  o Fuzzy matching using a 2-stage approach: add a new PDict type
    (e.g. HeadTail_PDict) for storing the "head" and the "tail" of a pattern
    dictionary (not necesarily of uniform-length).
    The initialize method for HeadTail_PDict objects should let the user
    specify the width of the "head" i.e. the size of the pattern prefixes
    to use for exact matching (stage 1). Then in stage 2, the "tail" (i.e.
    the pattern remainders) are compared with the nucleotides following the
    matches returned by stage 1.

- Finish C implemntation of read.BStringViews()

- Add a new generic that combines a subject and a Views (or Views-like)
  object to return a BStringViews object. The Views-like object could be
  P2Views object and the method for it would do as if it had received
  unlist(P2Views). Currently my problem is that I can't come up with a good
  name for such generic :-/ Maybe I could just use views(subject, x) for
  this (dispatch would be on x, not subject). And the current views function
  could be renamed (or maybe it's not needed at all, maybe a fancy
  new("Views", ...) could replace it).

- Add a MaskedBString class. 2 ways to do this:
    1. Extend the BStringViews class
    2. I think I prefer this: add a Mask class (a direct extension of the
       Views class where the views are guaranted to be normalized) and define
       the MaskedBString class on top of that (in the same way that the
       BStringViews class is defined on top of the Views class).
  For example alphabetFrequency would work by default in a vectorized fashion
  on a BStringViews object (Robert suggests to control this via a collapse arg),
  but in a cumulative fashion on a MaskedBString object.
  Working on the MaskedBString class will require some reworking of the mask()
  feature and the addition of some utility functions like is.normalized (define
  a method for Views objects, can then be used to check that a Mask or a
  MaskedBString object is valid or that a BStringViews object is normalized
  and can then be turned into a MaskedBString object), etc...

- readFASTA(): set the default for strip.desc to TRUE (with a warning when
  strip.desc is missing). This was already done in svn trunk/release a few
  weeks ago (October 2007) and rolled back on Robert's request. Now Robert
  seems to be ready for this change but wants Nolwenn to be personally notified
  about it (so she can fix her code using readFASTA()). Make this change in
  trunk only (too late for release). Remove the warning after the BioC 2.2
  release.

- Remove the Biostrings 1 subdir.

- Make alphabetFrequency works with BStringViews objects with
  "out of limits" views.

- Merge ~rgentlem/tmp/EMBOSS-3.0.0/emboss/matcher.c (Huang & Miller
  alignment algo) into Biostrings.

- An old Robert request: "have a look at GeneR, and see if there are
  any other packages that do sequence matching, and describe, in one page or
  so, what the differences are between the packages (also some notion of speed
  and size, how well do they work on different inputs)".

- Have the BStringViews() method for BString objects support the 'sep' arg.

- Test Raphael use case with built-in string functions and compare speed
  with Biostrings solution. Add the conclusions to the matchPattern.Rnw
  vignette.

- Why doesn't sapply or lapply work for a BStringViews object (it didn't
  work either for BioString objects). Isn't it enough that these objects
  are subsettable?

- Compare NAMESPACE + list of aliases in Rd files from Biostrings 1 and 2
  make sure no important feature has been lost.

- Update the CHANGES file.


In 2.9
======

- readFASTA(): remove warning when strip.desc is missing.


Later
=====

- Restore the test units.

- Fix pb with length(x) <- 2 screwing up x if it's a BString or BStringViews
  object (prevent people of doing this by defining the replacement version
  of the length method and issuing an error).

- Still have to think about it (Robert suggestion): make [[ work on "out
  of limits" views with a warning (we keep issuing an error only when the
  view is all blank).

- Merge SuffixTree package from Robert.
