CHANGES SINCE Biostrings 1 (v 1.4.z)

o The following bugs and design flaws found in Biostrings 1 have been
  addressed:

  a) matchDNAPattern() was broken in many ways:

     - The "offset problem":
         d <- DNAString("AA","TTT")
         m <- matchDNAPattern("TT", d[2])
       was returning wrong matches.
       This problem was in fact the consequence of a flaw in the design
       of the BioString class and was the first motivation for reworking
       the core Biostrings classes that are the fundations of Biostrings 2
       (see the Biostrings2Classes vignette for an introduction to these new
       classes).

     - The "negative offset problem":
         matchDNAPattern("AAA", "ACT", mismatch=2)
       was displaying a first empty match.

     - The "fuzzy searching" problems:
         Pb1: Fuzzy searching (mismatch != 0) was almost always returning a
         wrong result because of a bug in the implementation of the "shift-or"
         algorithm.
         Pb2: Only mismatch <= 3 was supported (now it's illimited even if
         it doesn't make sense to use mismatch >= length(subject)).
         Pb3: Some "of limits matches" (i.e. matches starting before the first
         letter of the subject or ending after its last letter) could be
         missing. And when they were found, the show() method was in general
         not able to display them properly.

     - This was provoking a bus-error bug on Solaris 2.9 and Mac OS X:
         pattern <- DNAString("AAAA")
         subject <- DNAString("AAAAC")
         matchDNAPattern(pattern, subject, mis=2)

  b) Time of 'DNAString(src)' was quadratic in respect to 'length(src)' ('src'
     being a character vector). In Biostrings 2 this has been replaced by
     'BStringViews(src, "DNAString")' which is much faster (linear in time).

o Other bugs in Biostrings 1:
  - The Boyer-Moore algorithm was reported to be broken by Martin.
    Hence it has been temporarly removed from Biostrings 2 (will be back
    ASAP).

o Changes in the API:
  - no more BioString class: it has been replaced by the BString and
    BStringViews classes,
  - no more NucleotideString() method: use BString(), DNAString()
    or RNAString() instead,
  - matchDNAPattern() has been replaced by matchPattern(),

o New features:
  - [ and == for BString objects
  - [, [[ and == for BStringViews objects
  - subject(), first(), last(), width(), desc(), views(), adjacentViews(),
    countPattern(), mismatch()
  - matchPattern() has a 'fixed' argument

o Features that have been temporarly lost (but that should be back ASAP):
  - The Boyer-Moore and forward-search algorithms.

o New documentation:
  - Vignettes:
